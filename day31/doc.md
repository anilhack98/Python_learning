Set in Python
-> Sets are unordered collection of data items. They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets {}. Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. Sets do not contain duplicate items.

-> The items of set occur in random order and hence they cannot be accessed using index numbers. Also sets do not allow duplicate values.
