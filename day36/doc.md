Exception Handling
-> Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events to avoid the program or system crashing and without this process, exception would disrupt the normal operation of program.

Exception in Python
-> Python has many built-in exception that are raised when your program encounters an error(something in the program goes wrong).

Python try....Except
-> try ...except blocks are used in Python to handle errors and exceptions. The code in try block runs when there is no error. If the try block catches the error, then the except block is executed.
