__name__=="__main__" in Python

-> The if __name__=="__main__" idiom is a common pattern used in python scripts to determine whether the scripts is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.

In Python, the __name__ variable is a built-in variable that is automatically  set to the name of the current module. When a Python script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to string __main__ . When the script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable os set to the module.
