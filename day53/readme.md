Map, Filter, Reduce
-> In python, the map, filter, and reduce function are built-in function that allow you to apply a function to a sequence of elements and return a new sequence. These function are known as high-order function, as they take other function as arguments.

-> map: The map function applies a function to each element in sequence and returns a new sequence containing the transformed elements. The map function has the following syntax:
          map(function, iterable)
  -> The function argument is a function that is applied to each element in the iterable argument. The iterable argument can be a list, tuple or any other iterable object.
